# A2A Python SDK

A Python library that helps run agentic applications as A2AServers following the [Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol](https://google.github.io/A2A/).

## Installation

You can install the A2A SDK using either `uv` or `pip`.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.13+

### Using `uv`

When you're working within a uv project or a virtual environment managed by uv, the preferred way to add packages is using uv add.

```bash
uv add a2a-sdk
```

### Using `pip`
